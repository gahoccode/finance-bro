Versioning Rules Summary
Finance Bro uses semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) with these rules:

Starting Point: 0.1.0 from pyproject.toml as source of truth
Patch Increment: Only on actual changes (features/fixes/improvements)
Date-Based: Each unique date with changes gets next patch number
No Empty Increments: Skip dates without actual changes
Chronological: Organize by actual implementation dates
