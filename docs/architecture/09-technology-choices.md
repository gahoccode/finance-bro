```

#### UV Package Manager

**Why Chosen**:
- **Speed**: 10-100x faster than pip for dependency resolution
- **Deterministic**: Guaranteed reproducible builds across environments
- **Lock Files**: Comprehensive dependency locking with uv.lock
- **Python Version Management**: Built-in Python version management

**Comparison with Alternatives**:
```bash
# Performance Comparison (typical Finance Bro install)
pip install -r requirements.txt     # ~45 seconds
poetry install                      # ~30 seconds  
uv sync                             # ~3 seconds

# Reproducibility
pip     # Requirements.txt (loose versioning)
poetry  # Poetry.lock (good, but slower)
uv      # uv.lock (excellent, fast)
```

### 2. Web Framework

#### Streamlit 1.49.0+

**Why Chosen**:
- **Data-Native**: Built specifically for data applications
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Minimal code to create complex data interfaces
- **Built-in Components**: Charts, forms, and data displays included
- **Python Integration**: Seamless integration with data science stack
- **Session Management**: Built-in session state and caching

**Feature Comparison**:
```python
# Streamlit (chosen) - Minimal code for data apps
import streamlit as st
st.title("Stock Analysis")
st.plotly_chart(financial_chart)
st.dataframe(stock_data)

# Flask (alternative) - More verbose, full control
from flask import Flask, render_template
app = Flask(__name__)
@app.route('/analysis')
def analysis():
    return render_template('analysis.html', chart=chart, data=data)
# + HTML templates, CSS, JavaScript required

# Django (alternative) - Full-featured but heavyweight
# + Models, Views, Templates, URLs, Settings
# + Authentication, Admin, ORM
# - Overhead for data-focused applications
```

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- Limited UI customization vs. rapid development
- Session state limitations vs. built-in state management
- Framework lock-in vs. development velocity
