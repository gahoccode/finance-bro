# This extracts the last row of prices_df and converts it to a Series

from pypfopt.discrete_allocation import DiscreteAllocation, get_latest_prices
latest_prices = get_latest_prices(prices_df) #Alternatives: latest_prices = prices_df.iloc[-1]
# Assuming you already have optimized weights (e.g., from max_sharpe or min_volatility)
# And a total portfolio value
portfolio_value = 100000  # 1 million VND

# You can use either the Series or dict version of latest_prices
da = DiscreteAllocation(weights, latest_prices, total_portfolio_value=portfolio_value)
allocation, leftover = da.greedy_portfolio()

Acceptance criteria:
- Create a tab called "Dollars Allocation" and implement the above code in that tab.
- successfully display the allocation and leftover. 
- Create user input for portfolio_value and use that for the calculation.
